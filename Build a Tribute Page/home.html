				<h3 class="text-center">Astronomer</h3>
				<p>Carl Sagan was the first to person suggest that the planet Venus did not possess a balmy tropical climate similar to Earth's, as scientists had previously believed. By studying radio emissions from Venus, he theorized that the planet might in fact have a surface temperature of 900 degrees Fahrenheit and a crushing atmosphere. He would later help design and manage NASA's Mariner expeditions to Venus, which confirmed this theory.</p>

				<h3 class="text-center">Writer</h3>
				<p>Sagan's published work brought scientific concepts to a wider audience. He penned roughly 20 books as an author or co-author, ranging in scope from extraterrestrial life (Intelligent Life in the Universe) and the evolution of human intelligence (The Dragons of Eden) to the history of space exploration (Pale Blue Dot) and "the assorted flotsam and jetsam of pseudoscience" (The Demon-Haunted World). The Dragons of Eden: Speculations on the Evolution of Human Intelligence earned Sagan a Pulitzer Prize in 1978.</p>

				<h3 class="text-center">Activist</h3>
				<p>Sagan strongly believed that human beings were altering their environment in a way that would become unsustainable, and was an early believer in the concept of global warming. He used his status, both as a celebrity and scientist, to further his political goals, and he undertook a campaign for nuclear disarmament and was a vocal opponent of President Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative.</p>

		<h1 class="text-center">Quotes</h1>
		<blockquote><p>Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known.</p></blockquote>
		<blockquote><p>If we long to believe that the stars rise and set for us, that we are the reason there is a Universe, does science do us a disservice in deflating our conceits?</p></blockquote>
		<blockquote><p>For me, it is far better to grasp the Universe as it really is than to persist in delusion, however satisfying and reassuring.</p></blockquote>
